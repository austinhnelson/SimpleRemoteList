# Assignment: A2 A Simple Remote List
# Author: Austin Nelson
# Class CS 402 Section 001

# Project Description:
Building off of the first assignment, this simple remote list program can add, remove, join, split and reset a list that is based on a bank of names. The list originally loads in a default list from a given URL as well as everytime the 'reset' button is clicked. In addition, there is a save button that will save the current state of the list. Once a list is saved, it can be loaded using the load button. An important design note is that when the load button is clicked, it will append to the current list.

# Reflection:
I thought this assignment was a pretty good intro into using a hook to do various things within the program. I was able to be exposed to this pretty big concept in Javascript and feel pretty comfortable with the concept and application of them and hope we get to use other ones in future assignments. I originally had my design as the load button would clear the current list and replace it with the saved list. After some thought, I realized this limits the ability of the program because it limits the save functionality. For example, you can build a list then save it, then build a new list and append to this list to build an even bigger list. I like the latter a lot better because it increases what the program can do. I also enjoyed working with the networking functions of Javascript as I thought it was pretty smooth and easy. Overall, I really enjoyed this assignment into remote lists!
